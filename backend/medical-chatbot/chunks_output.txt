Very early abortions
Abortion, spontaneous see Miscarriage
Between five and seven weeks,a pregnancy can be
ended by a procedure called menstrual extraction. This
procedure is also sometimes called menstrual regulation,
mini-suction,or preemptive abortion. The contents of the
uterus are suctioned out through a thin (3-4 mm) plastic
tube that is inserted through the undilated cervix.

•Bleeding after the abortion lasts longer than after a sur-
gical abortion.
•The woman may see the contents of her womb as it is
expelled.
Two different medications can be used to bring about
an abortion. Methotrexate (Rheumatrex) works by stop-
ping fetal cells from dividing which causes the fetus to die.
On the first visit to the doctor,the woman receives
an injection of methotrexate.

--- Chunk 87 ---
On the second visit,about
a week later, she is given misoprostol (Cytotec), an
oxygenated unsaturated cyclic fatty acid responsible for
various hormonal reactions such as muscle contraction
(prostaglandin), that stimulates contractions of the
uterus. Within two weeks, the woman will expel the
contents of her uterus,ending the pregnancy. A follow-
up visit to the doctor is necessary to assure that the
abortion is complete.
With this procedure, a woman will feel cramping
and may feel nauseated from the misoprostol. This
combination of drugs is 90-96% effective in ending
pregnancy.

Description
There are two types of abscesses,septic and sterile.
Most abscesses are septic,which means that they are the
result of an infection. Septic abscesses can occur any-
where in the body. Only a germ and the body’s immune
response are required. In response to the invading germ,
white blood cells gather at the infected site and begin
producing chemicals called enzymes that attack the germ
by digesting it. These enzymes act like acid,killing the
germs and breaking them down into small pieces that can
be picked up by the circulation and eliminated from the
body. Unfortunately, these chemicals also digest body
tissues. In most cases,the germ produces similar chemi-
cals.

Blood poisoningis a
term commonly used to describe an infection that has
spilled into the blood stream and spread throughout the
body from a localized origin. Blood poisoning,known to
physicians as septicemia,is also life threatening.
Of special note,abscesses in the hand are more seri-
ous than they might appear. Due to the intricate structure
and the overriding importance of the hand, any hand
infection must be treated promptly and competently.
Prevention
Infections that are treated early with heat (if superfi-
cial) or antibiotics will often resolve without the forma-
tion of an abscess. It is even better to avoid infections
altogether by taking prompt care of open injuries,partic-
ularly puncture wounds.

--- Chunk 116 ---
Bites are the most dangerous of
all,even more so because they often occur on the hand.

Acupressure is practiced as a treatment by Chinese
medicine practitioners and acupuncturists,as well as by
massage therapists. Most massage schools in American
include acupressure techniques as part of their bodywork
programs. Shiatsu massage is very closely related to acu-
pressure,working with the same points on the body and
the same general principles,although it was developed
over centuries in Japan rather than in China. Reflexology
is a form of bodywork based on acupressure concepts.

Acupressure and Chinese medicine
Chinese medicine views the body as a small part of
the universe,subject to laws and principles of harmony
and balance. Chinese medicine does not make as sharp a
destinction as Western medicine does between mind and
body. The Chinese system believes that emotions and
mental states are every bit as influential on disease as
purely physical mechanisms,and considers factors like
work,environment,and relationships as fundamental to a
patient’s health. Chinese medicine also uses very different
symbols and ideas to discuss the body and health.

--- Chunk 239 ---
While
Western medicine typically describes health as mainly
physical processes composed of chemical equations and
reactions,the Chinese use ideas like yin and yang,chi,
and the organ system to describe health and the body.
Everything in the universe has properties of yin and
yang. Yin is associated with cold,female,passive,down-
ward,inward,dark,wet. Yang can be described as hot,
male, active, upward, outward, light, dry, and so on.
Nothing is either completely yin or yang. These two prin-
ciples always interact and affect each other,although the
body and its organs can become imbalanced by having
either too much or too little of either.
Chi (pronounced chee,also spelled qior kiin Japan-
ese shiatsu) is the fundamental life energy.

--- Chunk 240 ---

food,air,water,and sunlight,and it travels through the
body in channels called meridians. There are 12 major

A 1997 Harvard study found that an estimated 15.4
million Americans suffered from a gambling addiction.
Over half that number (7.9 million) were adolescents.
Causes and symptoms
Addiction to substances results from the interaction
of several factors:
Drug chemistry
Some substances are more addictive than others,
either because they produce a rapid and intense change in
mood; or because they produce painful withdrawal
symptoms when stopped suddenly.
Genetic factor
Some people appear to be more vulnerable to addic-
tion because their body chemistry increases their sensi-
tivity to drugs.

--- Chunk 316 ---
Some forms of substance abuse and
dependenceseem to run in families; and this may be the
result of a genetic predisposition,environmental influ-
ences,or a combination of both.
Brain structure and function
Using drugs repeatedly over time changes brain
structure and function in fundamental and long-lasting
ways. Addiction comes about through an array of
changes in the brain and the strengthening of new memo-
ry connections. Evidence suggests that those long-lasting
brain changes are responsible for the distortions of cog-
nitive and emotional functioning that characterize
addicts, particularly the compulsion to use drugs.

Like all allergic reactions,AR involves a special
set of cells in the immune system known as mast cells.
Mast cells, found in the lining of the nasal passages
and eyelids,display a special type of antibody,called

Symptoms
Inflammation of the nose, or rhinitis, is the major
symptom of AR. Inflammation causes itching,sneezing,
runny nose,redness,and tenderness.

Sinus swelling can

to the throat,causing a congested feeling and “ear pop-
ping.”The drip of mucus from the sinuses down the back
of the throat, combined with increased sensitivity, can
also lead to throat irritation and redness. AR usually also
causes redness, itching, and watery eyes. Fatigue and
headacheare also common.
Diagnosis
Diagnosing seasonal AR is usually easy and can
often be done without a medical specialist. When symp-

Skin testing is the most common type of allergy test.
There are two forms:percutaneous and intradermal. In
percutaneous or prick testing, allergen solutions are
placed on the skin, and the skin is then pricked with a

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is complex, and
may require office visits to several different specialists
over several months before a diagnosis can be made.

--- Chunk 821 ---
While a confident provisional diagnosis may be made in
most cases after thorough testing,AD cannot be defini-
tively diagnosed until autopsy examination of the brain
for plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.
The diagnosis of AD begins with a thorough physi-
cal exam and complete medical history. Except in the
disease’s earliest stages, accurate history from family
members or caregivers is essential. Since there are both
prescription and over-the-counter drugs that can cause
the same mental changes as AD,a careful review of the
patient’s drug,medicine,and alcohol use is important.
AD-like symptoms can also be provoked by other med-

the brain (vascular insufficiency). In Wernicke-Korsakoff
syndrome,for example,damage to the memory centers
of the brain results from the use of alcohol or malnutri-
tion. Infections that damage brain tissue, including
encephalitisand herpes,can also cause amnesia. If the
amnesia is thought to be of psychological origin, it is
termed psychogenic.
There are at least three general types of amnesia:
•Anterograde. This form of amnesia follows brain trau-
ma and is characterized by the inability to remember
new information.

--- Chunk 917 ---
Recent experiences and short-term
memory disappear,but victims can recall events prior
to the trauma with clarity.
•Retrograde. In some ways,this form of amnesia is the
opposite of anterograde amnesia:the victim can recall
events that occurred after a trauma,but cannot remem-
ber previously familiar information or the events pre-
ceding the trauma.
•Transient global amnesia. This type of amnesia has no
consistently identifiable cause, but researchers have
suggested that migraines or transient ischemic attacks
may be the trigger.

make the blood vessels visible under x ray. Arteriography is
a type of angiography that involves the study of the arteries.

--- Chunk 1171 ---
Purpose
Angiography is used to detect abnormalities or
blockages in the blood vessels (called occlusions)
throughout the circulatory system and in some organs.
The procedure is commonly used to identify atheroscle-
rosis; to diagnose heart disease; to evaluate kidney func-
tion and detect kidney cysts or tumors; to detect an
aneurysm (an abnormal bulge of an artery that can rup-
ture leading to hemorrhage),tumor,blood clot,or arteri-
ovenous malformations(abnormals tangles of arteries
and veins) in the brain; and to diagnose problems with
the retina of the eye. It is also used to give surgeons an
accurate “map”of the heart prior to open-heart surgery,
or of the brain prior to neurosurgery.

marrow or septic arthritis.
Cat-scratch disease is caused by Bartonella hense-
lae, a bacterium that is carried in cat saliva; infection
may be transmitted by a bite or scratch. Approximately
22,000 cases are reported each year in the United States;
worldwide, nine out of every 100,000 individuals
become infected. More than 80% of reported cases occur
in persons under the age of 21. The disease is not nor-

tems.

--- Chunk 1233 ---
Symptoms may become serious, however, in
immunocompromised individuals, such as those with
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or those
undergoing chemotherapy. Common symptoms include
an inflamed sore in the area of the bite or scratch,
swollen lymph nodes,fever,fatigue,and rash.
Rabies is caused by a virus that is transmitted through
the bite of an animal that is already infected. More than
90% of animal rabies cases occur in wild animals such as
skunks,bats,and raccoons,with domestic animals such as
dogs and cats accounting for less than 10%. The World
Health Organization (WHO) estimates that between
35,000 and 50,000 individuals worldwide die each year as
a result of rabies.

The highest incidence of rabies occurs in

DANIELE BOVET (1907–1992)
A gifted researcher in therapeutic chemistry,
Daniele Bovet was born in Neuchatel, Switzerland, one
of four children of a professor of experimental educa-
tion. Bovet studied zoology and comparative anatomy
at the University of Geneva, receiving his doctor of sci-
ence degree in 1929. He then joined the Pasteur Insti-
tute in Paris, becoming director of the Laboratory of
Therapeutic Chemistry in 1936.
Bovet investigated histamine, thought to cause aller-
gy symptoms. No antagonist of histamine was known, so
Bovet—with his research student Anne-Marie Staub—
began studying substances that blocked hormones simi-
lar to histamine.

--- Chunk 1635 ---
By 1937 he had produced the first anti-
histamine, thymoxydiethylamine. Since this substance
was too toxic for human use, Bovet and Staub performed
thousands more experiments seeking less toxic antihista-
mines. This work formed the basis for the development
of subsequent clinically useful antihistamines.
Purpose
Antihistamines provide their primary action by
blocking histamine H at the receptor site. They have no

any noticeable symptoms. However, as the aneurysm
becomes larger, chest, shoulder, neck, lower back, or
abdominal paincan result. Abdominal aortic aneurysms
occur more often in men,and these aneurysms can cause
pain in the lower back, hips, and abdomen. A painful
abdominal aortic aneurysm usually means that the
aneurysm could burst very soon.

--- Chunk 1924 ---
Most abdominal aortic aneurysms are caused by
atherosclerosis, a condition caused when fat (mostly
cholesterol) carried in the blood builds up in the inner
wall of the aorta. As more and more fat attaches to the
aortic wall,the wall itself becomes abnormally weak and
often results in an aneurysm or bulge.
Aortic aneurysms are also caused by a breakdown of
the muscular middle layer of the artery wall, by high
blood pressure,by direct injury to the chest,and although
rare,by bacteria that can infect the aorta.

significant part of surgery, and she set out to make anes-

had become the fiftieth physician to be certified as an

Speech is fairly unbroken, although individuals may
frequently correct themselves and words may be
skipped or repeated. Although able to understand spo-
ken language,it may also be difficult for the individual
with conduction aphasia to find the right word to
describe a person or object. The impact of this condi-
tion on reading and writing ability varies. As with other
types of aphasia,right-sided weakness or sensory loss
may be present.

--- Chunk 1967 ---
•Anomic or nominal aphasia primarily influences an
individual’s ability to find the right name for a person
or object. As a result,an object may be described rather
than named. Hearing comprehension,repetition,read-
ing, and writing are not affected, other than by this
inability to find the right name. Speech is fluent,except
for pauses as the individual tries to recall the right
name. Physical symptoms are variable,and some indi-
viduals have no symptoms of one-sided weakness or
sensory loss.
•Transcortical aphasia is caused by damage to the lan-
guage areas of the left hemisphere outside the primary
language areas. There are three types of aphasia:
transcortical motor aphasia,transcortical sensory apha-
sia,and mixed transcortical aphasia.

--- Chunk 1968 ---
All of the transcor-
tical aphasias are distinguished from other types by the
individual’s ability to repeat words, phrases, or sen-
tences. Other language functions may also be impaired
to varying degrees,depending on the extent and partic-

of essential oils and their healing and antiseptic properties,
in his 1964 book Aromatherapie,traitement des maladies
par les essences des plantes,which popularized the use of
essential oils for medical and psychiatric treatment through-
out France. Later,French biochemist Mauguerite Maury
popularized the cosmetic benefits of essential oils,and in
1977 Robert Tisserand wrote the first English language
book on the subject,The Art of Aromatherapy,which intro-
duced massage as an adjunct treatment to aromatherapy and
sparked its popularity in the United Kingdom.
In aromatherapy,essential oils are carefully selected
for their medicinal properties.

--- Chunk 2054 ---
As essential oils are
absorbed into the bloodstream through application to the
skin or inhalation,their active components trigger certain
pharmalogical effects (e.g.,pain relief).
In addition to physical benefits, aromatherapy has
strong psychological benefits. The volatility of an oil,or
the speed at which it evaporates in open air,is thought to
be linked to the specific psychological effect of an oil. As
a rule of thumb,oils that evaporate quickly are consid-
ered emotionally uplifting,while slowly-evaporating oils
are thought to have a calming effect.

It is important to discuss any known sensitivity to
local anesthetics or iodine prior to this procedure. A
physician should explain the procedure and the risks
associated with contrast agents and ask the patient to sign
an informed consent. If iodine contrast will be adminis-
tered,the patient may be instructed not to eat before the
exam. The timeframe of fastingmay extend from only

sionally develop ascites. Depressed thyroid activity
sometimes causes pronounced ascites,but inflammation
of the pancreas (pancreatitis) rarely causes significant
accumulations of fluid.
Symptoms
Small amounts of fluid in the abdomen do not usual-
ly produce symptoms.

--- Chunk 2188 ---
Massive accumulations may cause:
•rapid weight gain
•abdominal discomfort and distention
•shortness of breath
•swollen ankles
Diagnosis
Skin stretches tightly across an abdomen that con-
tains large amounts of fluid. The navel bulges or lies flat,
and the fluid makes a dull sound when the doctor taps the
abdomen. Ascitic fluid may cause the flanks to bulge.
Physical examinationgenerally enables doctors to
distinguish ascites from pregnancy,intestinal gas,obe-
sity,or ovarian tumors. Ultrasound or computed tomog-

fluid. Laboratory analysis of fluid extracted by inserting

steroids. Long-term therapy may be required,however,to
prevent recurrence.

--- Chunk 2211 ---
Antifungal agents are not recom-
mended in the treatment of ABPA. In cases of aspergillo-
ma, it may become necessary to surgically remove or
reduce the size of a fungal mass,especially if the patient
continues to spit up blood. In aspergillosis cases affecting
the nose and nasal sinuses,surgery may also be required.
In non-ABPA cases,the use of antifungal drugs may
be indicated. In such cases,amphotericin B (Fungizone)
is the first-line therapy. The prescribed dose will depend
on the patient’s condition but usually begins with a small
test dose and then escalates. Less than one-third of
patients are likely to respond to amphotericin B,and its
side effects often limit its use.

--- Chunk 2212 ---
For patients who do not
respond to oral amphotericin B,another option is a dif-

amphotericin B.
For patients who fail to respond or who cannot toler-

with astigmatism may see the same dot as a blurred oval
or frankfurter-shaped blur.
Some cases of astigmatism are caused by problems
in the lens of the eye. Minor variations in the curvature of
the lens can produce minor degrees of astigmatism
(lenticular astigmatism). In these patients,the cornea is
usually normal in shape. Infants, as a group, have the
least amount of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increase
during childhood,as the eye is developing.

--- Chunk 2264 ---
Causes and symptoms
The main symptom of astigmatism is blurring. Peo-
ple can also experience headaches and eyestrain. Parents
can notice that a child may have astigmatism when the
child can see some part of a pattern or picture more clear-
ly than others. For example,lines going across may seem
clearer than lines going up and down.
Regular astigmatism can be caused by the weight of
the upper eyelid resting on the eyeball creating distortion,
surgical incisions in the cornea,trauma or scarring to the
cornea,the presence of tumors in the eyelid,or a develop-
mental factor. Irregular astigmatism can be caused by scar-
ring or keratoconus. Keratoconus is a condition in which
the cornea thins and becomes cone shaped. It usually
occurs around pubertyand is more common in women.

--- Chunk 2265 ---

KEY TERMS
Rolfing—Developed by Dr. Ida Rolf (1896–1979),
rolfing is a systematic approach to relieving stress
patterns and dysfunctions in the body’s structure
through the manipulation of the highly pliant myofa-
cial (connective) tissue. It assists the body in reorga-

Preparations
No special preparation need be taken.
Precautions
No special precautions are necessary when partici-

--- Chunk 2275 ---
Side effects
No undesirable side effects are reported. Usually
clients report a diminution of tension, improved body
movement,and an enhanced feeling of well being.

gram for dancers, actors, and athletes at Long Beach
City College.
Five years later, while recovering from injuries sus-
tained during two consecutive automobile accidents,
Aston met Ida Rolf, the developer of Rolfing. Aston
began working for Rolf, teaching a movement education
program called Rolf-Aston Structural Patterning that
emphasized using the body with minimum effort and
maximum precision.
In time, Rolf and Aston’s views on movement
diverged, and the partnership was dissolved in 1977.

--- Chunk 2279 ---
Aston formed her own company called the Aston Para-
digm Corporation in Lake Tahoe, California. This com-
pany provides training and certification for Aston practi-
tioners. She also began exploring how environmental
conditions affect body movement, foreshadowing the
ergonomic movement in the workplace that developed
in the 1990s. Over time, Aston has expanded her move-
ment work to include a fitness program for older adults.
Today, Judith Aston serves as director of Aston Paradigm

inhaled objects can also cause obstruction of the airway,
leading to atelectasis.
Anyone undergoing chest or abdominal surgery
using general anesthesia is at risk to develop atelectasis,
since breathing is often shallow after surgery to avoid
pain from the surgical incision. Any significant decrease
in airflow to the alveoli contributes to pooling of secre-
tions,which in turn can cause infection.

--- Chunk 2292 ---
Chest injuries
causing shallow breathing,including fractured ribs,can
cause atelectasis. Common symptoms of atelectasis
include shortness of breath and decreased chest wall
expansion. If atelectasis only afects a small area of the
lung, symptoms are ususally minimal. If the condition
affects a large area of the lung and develops quickly,the
individual may turn blue (cyanotic) or pale,have extreme
shortness of breath, and feel a stabbing pain on the
affected side. Feverand increased heart rate may be pre-
sent if infection accompanies atelectasis.
Diagnosis
To diagnose atelectasis,a doctor starts by recording
the patient’s symptoms and performing a thorough phys-
ical examination.

low carbohydrate regimen resulting in ketosis. It empha-
sizes meat, cheese, and eggs, while discouraging foods
such as bread, pasta, fruit, and sugar. It first came to pub-
lic attention in 1972 with the publication of Dr.Atkins’
Diet Revolution. The book quickly became a bestseller
but unlike most other fad diet books, this one has
remained popular. At last count, it had been reprinted 28
times and sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.
Since then, Atkins has authored a number of other books
on his diet theme, including Dr.Atkins’New Diet Revo-
lution (1992), Dr. Atkins’ Quick and Easy New Diet
Cookbook (1997), and The Vita-Nutrient Solution:
Nature’s Answer to Drugs(1998).

Atopic dermatitis
Definition
Eczema is a general term used to describe a variety
of conditions that cause an itchy, inflamed skin rash.
Atopic dermatitis, a form of eczema, is a non-conta-
gious disorder characterized by chronically inflamed
skin and sometimes intolerable itching.

--- Chunk 2363 ---
Description
Atopic dermatitis refers to a wide range of diseases
that are often associated with stressand allergic disor-
ders that involve the respiratory system,like asthmaand
hay fever. Although atopic dermatitis can appear at any
age, it is most common in children and young adults.
Symptoms usually abate before the age of 25 and do not
affect the patient’s general health.
About one in ten babies develop a form of atopic
dermatitis called infantile eczema. Characterized by skin
that oozes and becomes encrusted,infantile eczema most
often occurs on the face and scalp. The condition usually
improves before the child’s second birthday,and medical
attention can keep symptoms in check until that time.

A
small percentage of patients with atopic dermatitis find
that their symptoms worsen after having been exposed to
dust, feather pillows, rough-textured fabrics, or other
materials to which dust adheres.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of atopic dermatitis is usually based on
the patient’s symptoms and personal and family health
history. Skin tests do not generally provide reliable infor-
mation about this condition.
Treatment
Atopic dermatitis cannot be cured,but the severity
and duration of symptoms can be controlled. A dermatol-
ogist should be consulted when symptoms first appear,
and is likely to recommend warm baths to loosen
encrusted skin, followed by applications of petroleum
jelly or vegetable shortening to prevent the skin’s natural
moisture from escaping.

--- Chunk 2368 ---
Externally applied (topical) steroids or preparations
containing coal tar can relieve minor itching,but coal tar
has an unpleasant odor,stains clothes,and may increase
skin-cancer risk. Excessive use of steroid creams in
young children can alter growth. Pregnant women should
not use products that contain coal tar. Topical steroids can
cause itching, burning, acne, permanent stretch marks,
and thinning and spotting of the skin. Applying topical
steroids to the area around the eyes can cause glaucoma.
Oral antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine
(Benadryl),can relieve symptoms of allergy-related atopic

Description
A trained audiologist (a specialist in detecting hear-

volumes or levels of loudness. Testing is usually done in
a soundproof testing room.

that blocks out other distracting sounds and delivers a

early in his career treated some of his parents’ fellow
opera singers.

--- Chunk 2440 ---
From these experiences with the sound of
music, he developed the principle that has come to be
known as the Tomatis Effect, i.e. that the human voice can
only sing what it hears.
Tomatis has been called the Einstein of the ear. It was
his research that made the world aware that the ears of an
infant in utero are already functioning at four and half
months of age. Just as the umbilical cord provides nour-
ishment to the unborn infant’s body, Tomatis postulated
that the sound of the mother’s voice is also a nutrient
heard by the fetus. This sound literally charges and stimu-
lates the growth of the brain.
Tomatis took this further, into the realm of language.
Tomatis concluded that the need to communicate and to
be understood are among our most basic needs.

--- Chunk 2441 ---
He was a
pioneer in perceiving that language problems convert into
social problems for people. “Language is what character-
izes man and makes him different from other creatures,”
Tomatis is quoted as saying. The techniques he developed
to teach people how to listen effectively are international-

chief of staff at New England Memorial Hospital.
Disturbed by Western medicine’s reliance on med-

one in the teachings of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, an
Indian spiritualist who had gained a cult following in the

Balance and coordination tests
Definition
Balance is the ability to maintain a position.

--- Chunk 2561 ---
Coordi-
nation is the capacity to move through a complex set of
movements. Balance and coordination depend on the
interaction of multiple body organs and systems includ-
ing the eyes,ears,brain and nervous system,cardiovas-
cular system,and muscles. Tests or examination of any
or all of these organs or systems may be necessary to
determine the causes of loss of balance,dizziness,or the
inability to coordinate movement or activities.
Purpose
Tests of balance and coordination,and the examina-
tion of the organs and systems that influence balance and
coordination, can help to identify causes of dizziness,
fainting,falling,or incoordination.

--- Chunk 2562 ---
Precautions
Tests for balance and coordination should be con-
ducted in a safe and controlled area where patients will
not experience injury if they become dizzy or fall.
Description
Assessment of balance and coordination can include with vision may,in themselves,contribute to balance and

tion—the usual mode of examination is to rule out other
disorders until only Bell’s palsy is left. Disorders that
need to be excluded include demyelinating disease (e.g.,
multiple sclerosis), stroke, tumors, bacterial or viral
infection,and bone fracture.

--- Chunk 2699 ---
During the physical examination,the afflicted indi-
vidual is asked about recent illnesses,accidents,infec-
tions, and any other symptoms. A visual exam of the
ears,throat,and sinus is done,and hearing is tested. The
extent of the symptoms is assessed by grading the sym-
metry of the face at rest and during voluntary move-
ments, such as wrinkling the forehead, puckering the
lips, and closing the affected eye. Involuntary move-
ments are assessed in combination with the voluntary
movements. Neurologic exam is done to rule out
involvement of other parts of the nervous system except
for the facial muscles,which would exclude the diagno-
sis of Bell’s palsy.
In response to the individual’s medical history,
blood tests and possibly a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
analysis are ordered.

--- Chunk 2700 ---
The results of these tests help
determine the presence of a bacterial or viral infection or
an inflammatory disease. Electrophysiological tests,in
which a muscle or nerve is artificially stimulated,may be
used to assess the condition of facial muscles and the
facial nerve. Common tests include electromyography,
which measures voluntary muscle movement,and nerve
conduction velocity, which determines the extent of
nerve degeneration. Radiological tests may also be

control. As a result of his experiments,he showed that
such autonomic processes were controllable. This work
led to the creation of biofeedback therapy. Willer’s work
was expanded by other researchers. Thereafter,research
performed in the 1970s by UCLA researcher Dr. Barry
Sterman established that both cats and monkeys could be

biofeedback in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias,
headaches, Raynaud’s syndrome, and excess stomach

An abnormal amount of amniotic fluid may indicate or

--- Chunk 2878 ---
Amniotic fluid is the liquid that sur-

tle of this fluid can interfere with lung or limb develop-
ment. Too much amniotic fluid can accumulate if the
fetus has a disorder that interferes with swallowing.
Diagnosis
If there is a family history of birth defects or if the
mother is over 35 years old,then screening tests can be
done during pregnancy to gain information about the
health of the baby.
•Alpha-fetoprotein test. This is a simple blood test that
measure the level of a substance called alpha-fetopro-
tein that is associated with some major birth defects. An
abnormally high or low level may indicate the need for
further testing.
•Ultrasound.

--- Chunk 2879 ---
The use of sound waves to examine the
shape,function,and age of the fetus is a common proce-
dure. It can also detect many malformations, such as

ease, hypertension, or eye problems, which may
increase the risk of complications.

--- Chunk 3021 ---
Description
Blepharoplasty can be performed on the upper or
lower eyelid; it can involve the removal of excess skin
and fat deposits and the tightening of selected muscles
surrounding the eyelids. The goal is to provide a more
youthful appearance.
The surgeon will begin by deciding whether excess
skin,fat deposits,or muscle looseness are at fault. While
the patient is sitting upright,the surgeon will mark on the
skin where incisions will be made. Care will be taken to
hide the incision lines in the natural skin folds above and
below the eye. The patient then receives injections of a
local anesthetic to numb the pain. Many surgeons also give
the patient a sedative intravenously during the procedure.

--- Chunk 3022 ---
After a small,crescent-shaped section of eyelid skin
is removed, the surgeon will work to tease out small
pockets of fat that have collected in the lids. If muscle
looseness is also a problem,the surgeon may trim tissue
or add a stitch to pull it tighter. Then the incision is
closed with stitches.
In some patients,fat deposits in the lower eyelid may
be the only or primary problem. Such patients may be
good candidates for transconjunctival blepharoplasty. In
this procedure the surgeon makes no incision on the sur-
face of the eyelid,but instead enters from behind to tease
out the fat deposits from a small incision. The advantage
of this procedure is that there is no visible scar.

--- Chunk 3023 ---
Preparation
Prior to surgery,patients meet with their surgeon to
discuss the procedure, clarify the results that can be
achieved,and discuss the potential problems that might
occur. Having realistic expectations is important in any
cosmetic procedure. Patients will learn,for example,that
although blepharoplasty can improve the appearance of
the eyelid, other procedures, such as a chemical peel,
will be necessary to reduce the appearance of wrinkles
around the eye. Some surgeons prescribe vitamin C and
vitamin K for 10 days prior to surgery in the belief that
this helps the healing process. Patients are also told to
stop smoking in the weeks before and after the proce-
dure,and to refrain from alcohol and aspirin.

--- Chunk 3024 ---
Aftercare
An antibiotic ointment is applied to the line of stitch-
es for several days after surgery. Patients also take an

Blood count
Definition
One of the most commonly ordered clinical labora-
tory tests, a blood count, also called a complete blood
count (CBC),is a basic evaluation of the cells (red blood
cells,white blood cells,and platelets) suspended in the
liquid part of the blood (plasma). It involves determining
the numbers,concentrations,and conditions of the differ-
ent types of blood cells.
Purpose
The CBC is a useful screening and diagnostic test
that is often done as part of a routine physical examina-
tion. It can provide valuable information about the blood
and blood-forming tissues (especially the bone marrow),
as well as other body systems.

--- Chunk 3037 ---
Abnormal results can indi-

anemias,leukemias,and infections—sometimes before
the patient experiences symptoms of the disease.

Blood gas analysis
Definition
Blood gas analysis, also called arterial blood gas
(ABG) analysis,is a test which measures the amounts of
oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood,as well as the
acidity (pH) of the blood.
Purpose
An ABG analysis evaluates how effectively the
lungs are delivering oxygen to the blood and how effi-
ciently they are eliminating carbon dioxide from it.

--- Chunk 3075 ---
The
test also indicates how well the lungs and kidneys are
interacting to maintain normal blood pH (acid-base bal-
ance). Blood gas studies are usually done to assess respi-
ratory disease and other conditions that may affect the
lungs,and to manage patients receiving oxygen therapy
(respiratory therapy). In addition,the acid-base compo-
nent of the test provides information on kidney function.
Description
Blood gas analysis is performed on blood from an
artery. It measures the partial pressures of oxygen and
carbon dioxide in the blood,as well as oxygen content,
oxygen saturation,bicarbonate content,and blood pH.
Oxygen in the lungs is carried to the tissues through
the bloodstream,but only a small amount of this oxygen
can actually dissolve in arterial blood.

--- Chunk 3076 ---
How much dis-
solves depends on the partial pressure of the oxygen (the
pressure that the gas exerts on the walls of the arteries).
Therefore,testing the partial pressure of oxygen is actu-

Definition
Boils and carbuncles are bacterial infections of hair
follicles and surrounding skin that form pustules (small
blister-like swellings containing pus) around the follicle.
Boils are sometimes called furuncles. A carbuncle is
formed when several furuncles merge to form a single
deep abscesswith several heads or drainage points.

of boils and carbuncles. Patients need to be warned against

(HLA) that are on the surface of bone marrow cells. If
the donor and the recipient have very dissimilar antigens,
the recipient’s immune system regards the donor’s bone
marrow cells as invaders and launches a destructive
attack against them. Such an attack negates any benefits
offered by the transplant.
HLA matching
There are only five major HLA classes or types—
designated HLA–A,–B,–C,–D,and class III—but much
variation within the groupings.

--- Chunk 3206 ---
For example, HLA–A
from one individual may be similar to,but not the same
as, HLA–A in another individual; such a situation can
render a transplant from one to the other impossible.
HLA matching is more likely if the donor and recip-
ient are related,particularly if they are siblings; however,
an unrelated donor may be a potential match. Only in
rare cases is matching HLA types between two people
not an issue:if the recipient has an identical twin. Identi-
cal twins carry the same genes; therefore,the same anti-
gens. A bone marrow transplant between identical twins
is called a syngeneic transplant.
Peripheral blood stem cell transplants
A relatively recent development in stem cell trans-
plantation is the use of peripheral blood cells instead of
stem cells from bone marrow.

ial breast cancer cases (families in which there is a high
breast cancer frequency) have mutations affecting the
tumor suppressor gene BRCA-1. Another gene (BRCA-
2) also appears to confer inherited vulnerability to early-
onset breast cancers.

--- Chunk 3365 ---
However, breast cancer due to
heredity is only a small proportion of breast cancer cases;
only 5%–10% of all breast cancer cases will be women
who inherited a susceptibility through their genes. Nev-

ment of breast cancer,a woman’s risk is increased.
Not all lumps detected in the breast are cancerous.
Fibrocystic changes in the breast are extremely common.
Also known as fibrocystic condition of the breast,fibro-
cystic changes are a leading cause of non-cancerous lumps
in the breast. Fibrocystic changes also cause symptoms of
pain,swelling,or discharge and may become evident to
the patient or physician as a lump that is either solid or
filled with fluid.

--- Chunk 3366 ---
Complete diagnostic evaluation of any
significant breast abnormality is mandatory because
though women commonly develop fibrocystic changes,
breast cancer is common also,and the signs and symptoms
of fibrocystic changes overlap with those of breast cancer.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of breast cancer is accomplished by the
biopsy of any suspicious lump or mammographic abnor-
mality that has been identified. (A biopsy is the removal of
tissue for examination by a pathologist. A mammogram is
a low-dose,2-view,x-ray examination of the breast.) The
patient may be prompted to visit her doctor upon finding a
lump in a breast,or she may have noticed skin dimpling,
nipple retraction, or discharge from the nipple. Or, the
patient may not have noticed anything abnormal, and a
lump at an early stage.

Detailed staging criteria are avail-

Manual and are generalized here:
•Stage 1—The cancer is no larger than 2 cm (0.8 in) and
no cancer cells are found in the lymph nodes.
•Stage 2—The cancer is between 2 cm and 5 cm,and the
cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.
•Stage 3A—Tumor is larger than 5 cm (2 in) or is small-
er than 5 cm,but has spread to the lymph nodes,which
have grown into each other.
•Stage 3B—Cancer has spread to tissues near the breast,
(local invasion), or to lymph nodes inside the chest
wall,along the breastbone.
•Stage 4—Cancer has spread to skin and lymph nodes
beyond the axilla or to other organs of the body.

big,it is less likely that its head will get stuck.
Among breech babies born after the full nine-month
term,smaller babies usually do better. This is not true for
premature babies. Premature babies are more likely to have
a trapped head because the body of a premature baby is
usually much smaller than his or her head. Premature
babies are generally not delivered from the breech position.

--- Chunk 3461 ---
The risks of vaginal breech delivery can be avoided by
delivering the baby through a surgical procedure (cesarean
section, also known as c-section). For the past twenty
years,cesarean section has been recommended when the
fetus is breech. More recently,many providers have offered
the option of version,attempting to turn the fetus within the
uterus to a head first position before labor begins.
Version is based on a very simple idea. If a fetus in
the breech position does a somersault,it will end up head
down. During a version,the obstetrician tries to make the
fetus do a somersault.
A version should only be done in a hospital,with an
ultrasound machine used to guide the obstetrician in
turning the fetus. The fetus should be monitored with a
fetal monitor before and after the version.

cancerous cells present in the airways. By using a fluo-
rescent light in the bronchoscope, precancerous tissue
will appear dark red, while healthy tissue will appear
green. This technique can help detect lung cancer at an
early stage,so that treatment can be started early.
Alternative procedures
Depending upon the purpose of the bronchoscopy,
alternatives might include a computed tomography scan
(CT) or no procedure at all. Bronchoscopy is often per-
formed to investigate an abnormality that shows up on a
chest x rayor CT scan. If the purpose is to obtain biopsy
specimens,one option is to perform surgery,which carries
greater risks.

--- Chunk 3516 ---
Another option is percutaneous (through the
skin) biopsy guided by computed tomography.
Preparation
The doctor should be informed of any allergiesand
all the medications that the patient is currently taking. The
doctor may instruct the patient not to take medications
like aspirinor anti-inflammatory drugs,which interfere
with clotting,for a period of time prior to the procedure.
The patient needs to fast for 6 to 12 hours prior to the pro-
cedure and refrain from drinking any liquids the day of
the procedure. The bronchoscopy takes about 45 to 60
minutes,with results usually available in one day. Prior to
the bronchoscopy,several tests may be done,including a
chest x ray and blood work. Sometimes a bronchoscopy is

Second-Degree (Moderate) The burned area is painful. The underskin is affected. Blisters may form. The area may have a wet, shiny appearance because of
exposed tissue.
Third-Degree (Critical) The burned area is insensitive due to the destruction of nerve endings. Skin is destroyed.Muscle tissues and bone underneath
may be damaged. The area may be charred, white, or grayish in color.
